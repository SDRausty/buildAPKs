buildAPKs
===============

BuildAPKs contains [source code](./sources) and [scripts](./scripts/build) to build APKs (Android Package Kits) on the [Termux](https://termux.com/) Android application. Quick setup instructions can be found here at https://sdrausty.github.io/docsBuildAPKs/setup and also https://sdrausty.github.io/docsBuildAPKs/reallyEasilyBuildAndroidAPKsOnDevice right here.

You can try building hundreds of exciting, amazing and beautiful APKs by running [shell scripts](https://www.google.com/search?q=shell+scripts) from this directory.  It is simple!  The minimal install size to start building your first apps (6) is about 6MB!  Have fun and enjoy compiling, hacking, modifying and running these select APKs!

**Cloning and updating [modules](https://gist.github.com/gitaarik/8735255) is automated into the [build\*.sh scripts.](https://github.com/sdrausty/buildAPKs/tree/master/scripts/build) Use `git pull` to update buildAPKs to its' newest version.** If you recieve an error message from `git pull`, the simplest solution is `mv ~/buildAPKs ~/b0` and then reclone into the $HOME folder.  The `~/buildAPKs` can be linked from external storage to save native space on device.

Build Android APKs on device (smartphone or tablet).
===========================================
Build Android APKs on device, on your smartphone or tablet with [Termux](https://termux.com/); Make applications for your Android smartphone or tablet! This repository contains source code for various Android applications that have been successfully built in [Termux](https://termux.com/).

Have you ever wanted to build your own application? Something that you can distribute over the Internet, and can be used on Android smartphones and tablets worldwide. Would you dare to try to spend some time learning something new to do so?

[BuildAPKs](https://github.com/sdrausty/buildAPKs) is a repository of source code designed just for this purpose. Source code is the way programs are written in a human understandable language for applications to compile and then to be run on an Android device. These programs have been tested and were built successfully on device, a smartphone. First successful builds on Sun May 28 2017 in [Termux](https://termux.com/) (Android 6.0.1 aarch64).

See https://sdrausty.github.io/docsBuildAPKs/reallyEasilyBuildAndroidAPKsOnDevice for quick setup instructions or https://sdrausty.github.io/docsBuildAPKs for the website for this project. These documents are also located on the [`./docs`](./docs) subdirectory.
### Really Easily Build an Android APK on an Android Device (Smartphone and Tablet).

Prefix these bash scripts by typing dot slash `./` on your Android smartphone or tablet in Termux, i.e. type `./b` at the prompt ($), press TAB TAB (x2).  The prompt should magically add `uild`; Then add a capitol `A`, then a small `l`.  Press TAB TAB (x2) again.  This should build the following command on the command line `./buildAll.sh` for you.  Press enter (return) in `~/buildAPKs/sources/`.  Additional CLI information at [The Linux Documentation Project.](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=command+line+beginner+site%3Atldp.org)

These built APKs will be deposited into /storage/emulated/0/Download/builtAPKs for installing on smartphone and tablet through the file manager.  The minimal install size to start building your first apps is about 6MB.  Have fun and enjoy compiling, hacking, modifying and running these select APKs!
=======

The [`buildAll.sh`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdrausty/buildAPKs/master/scripts/build/buildAll.sh) command can build hundreds of APKs on your device.  Maximum space allotment for complete build of everything included (611) is about 551MB for buildAPKs, plus about 69MB for the finished products deposited into /storage/emulated/0/Download/builtAPKs;  Six hundred and eleven (611) Android applications can be made from source code on device today, Tue Jan 22 2019.
